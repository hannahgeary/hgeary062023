# Macromolecules

> Generic Amino Acid
>> Amino on one end, carboxyl on the other.

### N - C - C in the center is a backbone

>**2 NCCs connected = covalent peptide bond**
>>Joined by dehydration synthesis 

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.

2 Hydrogen for carbon to be happy
, One if theres a double bond

### Fatty acids end with a carboxyl -> A linear chain
**^ Unsaturated has a double bond**

Sugar is a straight chain/ladder

Every Carbon has a oxygen

Monosaccharidse = **1** ring
Disaccharid = **2** rings

> Sugar Chain
>> Starch, cellulose, glycogen
>>> Used for energy

Sugar has many structural forms; Ladder, house, honeycomb

Nucleic acids include RNA and DNA

Each nucleotide has **3 parts**
> A Nitrogenous base
>> A **5 Carbon** Sugar
>>> 1-3 phosphate groups
